The idea is to create a website that allows users to edit their images based on different styles or categories that we provide. Users can upload their photos and choose from various editing skills.
Once the user selects a category, the website will automatically apply the corresponding effect using AI-based image processing techniques. The goal is to make image editing simple, fun, and accessible for everyone, even without advanced editing skills.
